# node-bindings-guide

You are looking at the _Node/V8 native bindings guide_ source. For the actual guide take a loot at [http://luismreis.github.com/node-bindings-guide/](http://luismreis.github.com/node-bindings-guide/).

The guide uses [Dinky theme](https://github.com/broccolini/dinky) and is build by the [github pages](http://pages.github.com/)'s [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) site generator.

To build the site locally use bundler to install jekyll:

    bundle

And then jekyll to generate the site:

    jekyll --safe --auto

The `_config.yml` file is already configured with the same settings as gh-pages.

Have fun building your own native libraries!
